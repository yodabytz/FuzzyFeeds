# FuzzyFeeds v0.9.0-beta

FuzzyFeeds is an IRC bot that aggregates RSS and Atom feeds in real-time. It allows channel administrators to manage feeds, fetch the latest entries, and manage user subscriptionsâ€”with persistent storage, enhanced logging, rate limiting, and optional SSL support. Best used to monitor updates of GitHub Repos and users. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GWMetSSk) or Matrix #fuzzyfeeds:matrix.org
