# FuzzyFeeds

FuzzyFeeds is an IRC bot that aggregates RSS and Atom feeds in real-time. It allows channel administrators to manage feeds, fetch the latest entries, and manage user subscriptionsâ€”with persistent storage, enhanced logging, rate limiting, and optional SSL support. Best used to monitor updates of GitHub Repos and users

## Features

- **Channel Administration:** Only designated channel admins can add or remove feeds.
- **Persistent Data:** Feeds, subscriptions, and channel admin assignments are saved and reloaded across bot restarts.
- **User Subscriptions:** Users can subscribe privately to feeds.
- **Enhanced Logging & Rate Limiting:** Built-in logging for troubleshooting and simple per-user rate limiting.
